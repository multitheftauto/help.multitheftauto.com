<Steps>
    1. Download and install the latest release of MTA.

        <ClientDownload />
    
    2. Restart your computer.

    3. Try to close every GTA:SA and MTA application on your computer.  
        A lingering process can block access to files, which MTA is trying to copy.

    4. Try to run Multi Theft Auto.

    5. If that didn't resolve the issue, then contact MTA support.  
        Use the links at the bottom of the page to find us.
