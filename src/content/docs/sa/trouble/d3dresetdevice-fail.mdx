:::caution
If this crash is happening during `Alt-Tab` then try switching the *fullscreen mode* in the MTA settings menu
`Settings > Advanced > Fullscreen mode`.

You should try using either `Borderless window` or `Borderless keep res` in that case.

<Steps>
    1. Download and install the legacy DirectX runtime.

        <DirectXDownload />

    2. Install the latest release of Multi Theft Auto.

        <ClientDownload />

    3. Update your graphic card drivers.

        <GpuDriverDownload />

    4. If you have a notebook/laptop, visit the manufacturer's website
        and download the most recent drivers for your device, including the latest graphics driver.
