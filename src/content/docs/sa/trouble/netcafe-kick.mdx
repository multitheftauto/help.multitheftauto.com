:::note
This problem only occurs on very specific MTA servers which enabled a special detection option in the server configuration.
Playing from an internet/cyber café **is not** prohibited on every MTA server.

We rely on a smart secretive technique facilitating servers to flag cybercafé PCs.
If you think that your PC got incorrectly flagged, then please contact MTA staff (mention your serial)
by sending a forum PM to [Dutchman101](https://forum.mtasa.com/profile/38052-dutchman101/) and we'll review.<br/>

You have been kicked for 'Net Cafe' on a server that prohibits players playing from an internet/cyber café.

Some servers have a good reason to stop players from using internet/cyber café PC's to connect ingame.
We recently added a way for them to do so. Reasons for this are:

- Massive ban evading (bypassing bans instead of asking for unban, by having access to a large amount of PCs in the café)
- Massive stat padding/boosting accounts, or other types of abuse with 1 player in simultaneous control of an infinite amount of clients
- Massive trolling (players not caring about their actions under disposable accounts), not being able to discover if a player was previously banned and/or fuzzy lines of who is using said PC at which times
- Massive multi-accounting (if server prohibits this, or the problem is exacerbated by netcafés)

As you can see, servers can deal with a multitude of issues as a result of internet café usage. Blocking it is advised only as last resort (not to be taken lightly), but as it turns out the server you tried connecting to has done so. Servers try to avoid player loss at all cost, so this 'positive discrimination' is generally born out of dire need. Please understand that individual servers reserve the right to decide about this matter.

You may contact the admins/owner of said server for more information or ask for the possibilities.

For more information, please refer to the [MTA AC guide](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Anti-cheat_guide),
specifically `SD #34`.

### Solution

Play Multi Theft Auto either at home or at a different place, or try to play on servers that don't enable this special detection.
