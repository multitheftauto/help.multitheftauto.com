GTA San Andreas had trouble loading model id <code><QueryParameter name="id" placeholder="not provided" /></code>
with the reason <code><QueryParameter name="reason" placeholder="not provided" /></code>.  
Follow the steps below to resolve the issue.

<Steps>
    1. Restart your computer, and then try to run Multi Theft Auto again.

    2. If that didn't work, then install GTA San Andreas from a trusted source.

        <BuyTheGame />

        :::note
        Your game installation might use a modified <code>gta3.img</code> model archive,
        with modifications that are not compatible with GTA:SA or MTA. We always recommend
        to buy GTA from an official source that doesn't contain broken mods.
        :::

    3. Try to run Multi Theft Auto again.

    4. If that didn't work, then the server you are trying to play on is trying to use
        mods that are incompatible with MTA.

        Ask the server owner to verify their modification for model id <code><QueryParameter name="id" placeholder="not provided" /></code>.

        :::tip
        Try to make the server owner aware of this issue, if you can find a way to contact their support team.
        It's impossible for servers to test every situation or condition that may arise with a wild mix of mods
        on their server with the hardware/software combinations of their players. Please be aware that not every
        server is going to accept this kind of feedback.

    5. If that didn't resolve the issue, then contact MTA support.
