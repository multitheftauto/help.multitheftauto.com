MTA detected ASI files either in your GTA:SA or MTA installation directory.

<Steps>
    1. Navigate to your GTA San Andreas installation directory.

    2. Remove all *.asi files in that directory and subdirectories.  
        The example file tree below highlights a subdirectory where you can find ASI files.

        <FileTree>
        - <span>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rockstar Games\\GTA San Andreas\\</span>
            - anim/
            - audio/
            - data/
            - models/
            - movies/
            - scripts/
                - **SilenPathSA.asi**  removable this file
                - â€¦
            - text/
            - eax.dll
            - gta_sa.exe
            - ogg.dll
            - vorbis.dll
            - vorbisFile.dll
        </FileTree>

        :::note
        You can use the search function from Windows Explorer to search for these ASI files with ease.
        By utilizing a wildcard search like `*.asi`, the search results will only contain files that
        end with the ASI suffix.

    3. Navigate to your MTA San Andreas installation directory and repeat step 2 there.
