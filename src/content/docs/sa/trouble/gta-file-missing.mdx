GTA San Andreas is missing <code><QueryParameter name="name" placeholder="a file" /></code>

<Steps>
    1. Install GTA San Andreas from a trusted source.

        <BuyTheGame />

    2. If that didn't work, try to download the file from our network.  
        Be aware that we might not offer every file.

        <QueryParameter name="name" wrapper="true" placeholder="not-provided">
            <IconLinkCard
                icon="cloud-download"
                title="Try To Download"
                description="We provide no guarantee that this file exists and is downloadable."
                href={`${CDN_URL}/files/%s`} />
        </QueryParameter>

    3. Copy the downloaded file to your GTA:SA installation directory.  
        The path in the example will most likely not represent where your GTA:SA has been installed to,
        but it should give you an idea where to place the file, and we leave the rest to you.

        <pre data-language="plaintext">
            <code>
                <div class="ec-line">
                    <div class="code">
                        C:/Program Files (x86)/Rockstar Games/GTA San Andreas/<QueryParameter name="name" placeholder="a file" />
                    </div>
                </div>
            </code>
        </pre>

    4. Try to run Multi Theft Auto again.
