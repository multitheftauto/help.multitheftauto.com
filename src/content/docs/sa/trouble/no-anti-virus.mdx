<Steps>
    1. Ensure you have a running anti-virus on your computer, if not,
        then pick one of the solutions below:

        <AntiVirusDownload />

    2. Make sure your anti-virus software is up to date,
        check if real-time scanning is enabled, and then
        run a complete virus scan.

    3. Try to run Multi Theft Auto again.
</Steps>

:::note
An anti-virus product is absolutely not necessary to run Multi Theft Auto, but we highly recommend it in the modern age of computing. Protection comes in layers, and an anti-virus is another layer for malware to penetrate.
