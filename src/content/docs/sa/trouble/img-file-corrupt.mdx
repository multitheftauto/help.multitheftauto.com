A GTA San Andreas file <code><QueryParameter name="name" placeholder="not provided" /></code> is corrupt and is unusable.
Follow the steps below to resolve the issue.

<Steps>
    1. Install GTA San Andreas from a trusted source.

        <BuyTheGame />

        :::note
        Your game installation might use a modified <code>gta3.img</code> model archive,
        with modifications that are not compatible with GTA:SA or MTA. We always recommend
        to buy GTA from an official source that doesn't contain broken mods.
        :::

    2. Try to run Multi Theft Auto again.

    3. If that didn't resolve the issue, then contact MTA support.  
        Use the links at the bottom of the page to find us.
