<Steps>
    1. Try running MTA with the Administrator account.  
        Your current account may be restricted from launching the game.

    2. Your anti-virus software is blocking the game executable.

        You have to add the following executable to the exceptions list of your anti-virus software:
        ```
        C:\ProgramData\MTA San Andreas All\1.6\GTA San Andreas\gta_sa.exe
        ```
        Replace `1.6` with the version of MTA that you're trying to launch, in case
        this guide becomes outdated at some point.

    3. Try to run Multi Theft Auto again.
