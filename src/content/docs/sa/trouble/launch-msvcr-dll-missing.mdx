Your system is missing an essential Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable that is required by MTA to operate.

<Steps>
    1. Install Microsoft runtime components.

        <RedistributableDownload />

    2. Ensure there is no d3d9.dll in the GTA installation directory.

        <FileTree>
        - <span>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rockstar Games\\GTA San Andreas\\</span>
            - anim/
            - audio/
            - data/
            - models/
            - movies/
            - text/
            - d3d9.dll  remove this file, if it exists
            - gta_sa.exe
            - â€¦
        </FileTree>

    3. Try to run Multi Theft Auto again.

    4. If all that didn't work, install this into the MTA installation directory:

        <IconLinkCard
            icon="cloud-download"
            title="MTA:SA fix for Windows 7 update failure"
            description="Download for runtime components installer"
            href={`${CDN_URL}/files/mtasa-1.5-win7-update-failure-fix.exe`} />

    5. If that didn't resolve the issue, then contact MTA support.
