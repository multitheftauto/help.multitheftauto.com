MTA Server order in the server browser: <code><QueryParameter name="code" placeholder="not provided" /></code>

### Server changed IP

We are unable to restore the old position of your server, because:

1. It is very difficult for us.
2. It takes a long time.
3. We don't have the time to do it.

However, if you are desperate, we can make an exception, if:

1. You make a donation of at least 5 Euro.
2. Understand that the donation is for **ONE CHANGE ONLY**.

Send your donation via PayPal to `paypal@multitheftauto.com`.
