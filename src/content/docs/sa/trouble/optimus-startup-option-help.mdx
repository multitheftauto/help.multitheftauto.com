<Steps>
    1. Try each option after another, until you are satisfied with one.  
        Start with first option, check if it works, and if not, continue with the next options.

    2. If none of the options work for you, then update your NVIDIA drivers.

        <IconLinkCard
            icon="external"
            title="NVIDIA"
            description="Download latest drivers for NVIDIA GPUs"
            href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/" />

    3. Download and install the latest release of MTA.

        <ClientDownload />

    4. Try to run Multi Theft Auto again.

    5. If that didn't resolve the issue, then contact MTA support.  
        Use the links at the bottom of the page to find us.
