<Steps>
    1. Verify that you can run the GTA:SA singleplayer game.

        **Step 1:** Navigate to your GTA:SA installation directory.
        That location may very a lot, depending on how you obtained the game files,
        but the original installer placed these files in one of the following directories:
        ```
        C:\Program Files (x86)\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas\
        C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto San Andreas\
        ```

        **Step 2:** Launch the game by double-clicking on either `gta_sa.exe` or `gta-sa.exe`.
        You might not see the `.exe` in the file name on your computer, but that's fine.

        :::caution
        If you can't launch the singleplayer game directly after following the steps above,
        then try deleting the settings file for GTA:
        ```
        Documents\GTA San Andreas User Files\gta_sa.set
        ```
        And if the game still does not work, consider reinstalling it, or find a trusted source from
        where you can buy and download the game.
        :::

    2. Install Microsoft runtime components.

        <RedistributableDownload />

    3. Download and install the legacy DirectX runtime.

        <DirectXDownload />

    4. Install the latest release of Multi Theft Auto.

        <ClientDownload />

    5. Ensure there is no d3d9.dll in the GTA installation directory.

        <FileTree>
        - <span>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Rockstar Games\\GTA San Andreas\\</span>
            - anim/
            - audio/
            - data/
            - models/
            - movies/
            - text/
            - d3d9.dll  remove this file, if it exists
            - gta_sa.exe
            - â€¦
        </FileTree>

    6. Close third-party programs that may interfere with the game, for example:

        - Evolve
        - RivaTuner
        - MSI Afterburner

    7. Try to run Multi Theft Auto again.

MTA still fails to launch.
